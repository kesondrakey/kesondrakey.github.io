		<p>As the climate crisis intensifies, innovative approaches are crucial to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Nature-based climate solutions (NbCS) offer a promising avenue by leveraging natural processes to mitigate climate change. These strategies encompass practices like reforesting previously deforested landscapes, reducing excess irrigation, and implementing climate-smart agriculture techniques such as the use of <b>cover crops</b>.</p>

					<h3>To qualify as a true NbCS, initiatives must meet four essential criteria:</h3>
				</header>
<p>1.	<b>Additional Enhancements to Carbon Uptake</b>: Going beyond what would naturally occur.</p>
<p>2.	<b>Net Cooling Effect</b>: Contributing to a reduction in global temperatures.</p>
<p>3.	<b>Durability of Carbon Storage</b>: Ensuring long-term sequestration of carbon.</p>
<p>4.	<b>Accounting for Leakage</b>: Preventing the displacement of emissions elsewhere.</p>
<p>Despite bipartisan support and private sector interest, the scientific frameworks guiding NbCS implementation and monitoring are not yet fully established. This gap presents challenges in understanding their overall efficacy across varying scales.</p>

					<h3>The DISES Project: Pioneering Research in Agricultural NbCS</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Addressing these challenges is the goal of the Dynamics of Integrated Socio-Environmental Systems (DISES) project. Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), this million-dollar initiative brings together a team of scientists from Indiana University and Notre Dame. The DISES project is an innovative effort aiming to:</p>
<p>•	<b>Close the Carbon, Water, and Energy Budgets in agricultural systems.</b></p>
<p>•	<b>Compare Conventional Farming Methods with practices utilizing cover crops.</b></p>
<p>•	<b>Bridge Knowledge Gaps regarding the potential for cover crops as a NbCS.</b></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Key Objectives</h2>
<p>The project seeks to understand:</p>
<p>•  <b>Carbon Pathways</b>: Where carbon goes within agricultural systems and how much is sequestered into the soil.</p>
<p>•  <b>Biogeochemical Cycles</b>: The functionality and interactions within agricultural ecosystems.</p>
<p>• <b> Impact of Cover Crops</b>: How cover cropping influences carbon sequestration and other environmental factors over time.</p>
