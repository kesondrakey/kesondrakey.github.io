			<h2>Introduction to Nature-Based Climate Solutions</h2>
		</header>
		<p>As the climate crisis intensifies, innovative approaches are crucial to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Nature-based climate solutions (NbCS) offer a promising avenue by leveraging natural processes to mitigate climate change. These strategies encompass practices like reforesting previously deforested landscapes, reducing excess irrigation, and implementing climate-smart agriculture techniques such as the use of <b>cover crops</b>.</p>

				<p>• Enhanced Biodiversity: Supporting a wider range of plant and animal life.</p>
<p>• Improved Air and Water Quality: Filtering pollutants and reducing runoff.</p>
<p>• Increased Soil Health: Enhancing nutrient content and soil structure.</p>

					<h3>To qualify as a true NbCS, initiatives must meet four essential criteria:</h3>
				</header>
<p>1.	Additional Enhancements to Carbon Uptake: Going beyond what would naturally occur.</p>
<p>2.	Net Cooling Effect: Contributing to a reduction in global temperatures.</p>
<p>3.	Durability of Carbon Storage: Ensuring long-term sequestration of carbon.</p>
<p>4.	Accounting for Leakage: Preventing the displacement of emissions elsewhere.</p>
<p>Despite bipartisan support and private sector interest, the scientific frameworks guiding NbCS implementation and monitoring are not yet fully established. This gap presents challenges in understanding their overall efficacy across varying scales.</p>

				</header>
				<p>The Royer Lab at Indiana University conducts research in freshwater biogeochemistry, primarily in ecosystems dominated by agriculture or other human activities. Students in the Royer Lab collect and analyze soil and water samples as well as hydrologic data at agricultural field sites. Graduate research facilitated by the project incorporates the effect of cover crops on multiple processes and patterns of biogeochemical cycling. 
Erin Carman-Sweeney, a master’s student in the IU O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs, will evaluate the effect of cover crops on soil greenhouse gas emissions as part of his thesis. Lindsey Rasnake (pictured to the left), a student in the Environmental Science PhD program, uses stream and tile water samples to determine organic carbon loss through subsurface tile drainage in cover-cropped fields vs fields without cover crops.</p>

</header>
				<p>Professor Jennifer Tank is the Director of the University of Notre Dame Environmental Change Initiative (ND-ECI). Tank has been actively involved at ND-ECI since it's inception, previously serving as the principle investigator of the Land Use Program and the Director of the Notre Dame Linked Experimental Ecosystem Facility (ND-LEEF). 

Tank is the Ludmilla F., Stephen J., and Robert T. Galla Professor of Biological Sciences at the University of Notre Dame. Her research focuses on nutrient and carbon cycling in streams and rivers and the influence of human activities on water quality and stream health.

Tank’s extensive research experience aims at better understanding the role that small streams play in removing nitrogen from the water and to prevent it from polluting downstream ecosystems. Her research was recently featured on the University of Notre Dame’s “What Would You Fight For?” series.

				</header>
<p>  The Yoder Lab focuses on environmental outcomes of agricultural management, particularly the role of farmer decision-making in using more environmentally friendly practices. One of the major areas of focus is the role of nonpoint source water pollution from large-scale grain farms. Our lab explores this challenge using a social-ecological systems perspective, drawing on social science methods to understand farmers' perspectives on water quality data, the influence of social norms on adoption decisions, and the role of agricultural policy in shaping the options and constraints for farm management. Members of the lab study different agri-environmental outcomes of farm management, including water quality, agrobiodiversity, sustainability, and climate impacts.</p>


<p>On the DISES project, the lab's contribution will be to analyze drivers of adoption, long-term use, and abandonment of cover cropping by farmers in the Corn Belt. Our role will be to use semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and large-N surveys to understand barriers and opportunities for scaling up the use of cover crops as a natural climate solution for mitigation and adaptation. Our research will include farmers' perspectives on the opportunities and challenges of cover crops, the role of cover crops as a risk mitigation strategy, and preferences around policy options. Additionally, we will research the role of farm program administrator, county-level conservation staff and extension, and farm service advisors in encouraging cover crop use.</p>
