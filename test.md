    <h3>The Biomet Lab (PI: <a href="https://oneill.indiana.edu/faculty-research/directory/profiles/faculty/full-time/novick-kimberly.html">Kim Novick</a>)</h3>
</header>
				<p>The Biomet Lab, orchestrated by Kimberly Novick at the O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs, stands at the nexus of biometeorology, plant physiology, and hydrology. The lab is a thriving center for interdisciplinary exploration, keen on demystifying the reciprocal impacts between climate variability and ecosystem functions. Such investigations are critical to understanding and managing the dual role these functions play in both responding to and shaping climate change. Emphasizing the necessity of deep insights into land-atmosphere interactions, the lab tackles the uncertainties clouding the modeling of the land carbon sink, which has profound implications for projecting the climate's future trajectory. Novick’s targeted research particularly delves into the Eastern United States, probing the interactions between climate dynamics and land cover changes in its agriculturally rich ecosystems, with an acute emphasis on understanding the ramifications of drought.</p>

<p>The Biomet Lab's research endeavors are propelled by its strategic utilization of data from expansive environmental observation networks like AmeriFlux, FLUXNET, and NEON. These networks compile a wealth of data across a spectrum of sites, essential for the research endeavors of scientists worldwide. Guided by Novick, the lab intricately weaves together this collective data with detailed examinations of plant ecophysiological functions and macroscopic satellite imagery, achieving a nuanced understanding of ecosystem processes on a spectrum from micro to macro scales. The lab, a dynamic environment at Indiana University, is composed of an enthusiastic team of students, postdoctoral researchers, and technicians conducting groundbreaking field studies and data syntheses. Their commitment is towards leveraging this knowledge to guide actionable, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.16156">nature-based climate solutions</a> .</p>

<p>A pivotal element of Novick's work, and that of her colleagues within this project, revolves around nature-based solutions to climate change, a crucial aspect highlighted in their collective research. The basis of their collaborative efforts are encapsulated in a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.16156">key paper</a>, showcasing their shared dedication to advancing the understanding and implementation of natural climate solutions.</p>

				</header>
				<p>The Barnes lab at Indiana University focuses on the integration of quantitative remote sensing techniques and environmental informatics to advance our understanding of climate impacts on ecosystems. The lab, led by Dr. Mallory Barnes, leverages her expertise in ecohydrology and environmental management to scale ecohydrological and biophysical processes across spatial and temporal dimensions. One of the lab's significant endeavors, managed by Dr. Barnes, aims to develop standard methods for estimating forest carbon stocks to inform future carbon trading mechanisms.</p>
					
<p>Kesondra Key, a student in the Environmental Science PhD program, is investigating drought signals by analyzing plant responses to aridity, utilizing eddy covariance data from a multitude of US towers. Key manages data operations for the DISES project. Her role includes the collection, quality assurance, processing, and preparation of data for the eventual submission to AmeriFlux and Fluxnet. She is responsible for ensuring accurate data capture, efficient processing workflows, and adherence to the data standards required by these networks</p>
					
<p>Dr. Barnes's work in scaling up this research involves the use of remote sensing to extend observations from the local scale of individual research sites to broader, more comprehensive landscapes, aiming to provide scalable solutions for environmental challenges.</p>

				</header>
				<p>The Royer Lab at Indiana University conducts research in freshwater biogeochemistry, primarily in ecosystems dominated by agriculture or other human activities. Students in the Royer Lab collect and analyze soil and water samples as well as hydrologic data at agricultural field sites. Graduate research facilitated by the project incorporates the effect of cover crops on multiple processes and patterns of biogeochemical cycling. 
Erin Carman-Sweeney, a master’s student in the IU O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs, will evaluate the effect of cover crops on soil greenhouse gas emissions as part of his thesis. Lindsey Rasnake (pictured to the left), a student in the Environmental Science PhD program, uses stream and tile water samples to determine organic carbon loss through subsurface tile drainage in cover-cropped fields vs fields without cover crops.</p>

				</header>
				<p>Landon Yoder's research delves into the complex issue of agricultural nonpoint source pollution, a collective action problem that has persisted for decades. His interest lies particularly in the dynamics of collective action within agricultural landscapes, examining how stakeholders such as farmers, governmental entities, and society at large collaborate to balance the demands of agricultural productivity with environmental conservation efforts. Yoder's work is informed by a keen understanding of the interplay between biophysical conditions, infrastructure, and monitoring data, and how these elements influence the feedback mechanisms between social and ecological systems. His approach to studying these facets of environmental governance is methodologically diverse, incorporating semi-structured interviews, spatial analysis, and inferential statistics to obtain a multifaceted perspective.</p>

<p>In addition to his primary research endeavors, Yoder is an active member of several interdisciplinary research communities, including the American Association of Geographers, the Global Land Programme, and the International Association for the Study of the Commons. His engagement with these communities reflects a dedication to advancing knowledge and fostering collaboration across disciplines. Within Indiana University, he is also an affiliate of the Environmental Resilience Institute, contributing to its mission of developing resilience strategies in response to environmental change.</p>
